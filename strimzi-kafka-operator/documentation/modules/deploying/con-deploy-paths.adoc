= Deployment path 

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure a deployment where Strimzi manages a single Kafka cluster in the same namespace, suitable for development or testing. 
Alternatively, Strimzi can manage multiple Kafka clusters across different namespaces in a production environment.

The basic deployment path includes the following steps:

. Create a Kubernetes namespace for the Cluster Operator.
. Deploy the Cluster Operator based on your chosen deployment method.
. Deploy the Kafka cluster, including the Topic Operator and User Operator if desired.
. Optionally, deploy additional components:
** The Topic Operator and User Operator as standalone components, if not deployed with the Kafka cluster
** Kafka Connect
** Kafka MirrorMaker
** Kafka Bridge
** Metrics monitoring components

The Cluster Operator creates Kubernetes resources such as `Deployment`, `Service`, and `Pod` for each component. 
The resource names are appended with the name of the deployed component. 
For example, a Kafka cluster named `my-kafka-cluster` will have a service named `my-kafka-cluster-kafka`.
