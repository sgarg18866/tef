= Disabling pod disruption budget generation

Strimzi generates pod disruption budget resources for Kafka, Kafka Connect worker, MirrorMaker2 worker, and Kafka Bridge worker nodes.

If you want to use custom pod disruption budget resources, you can set the `STRIMZI_POD_DISRUPTION_BUDGET_GENERATION` environment variable to `false` in the Cluster Operator configuration.
For more information, see xref:ref-operator-cluster-{context}[].
